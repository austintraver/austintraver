- ✏️ Student at the University of Southern California (USC) ✌🏻
- 🎓 Pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science 👨🏻‍💻
- 💼 [`austin.jp/resume`][resume] 🔗

I run an educational blog over at [`helpful.wiki`][wiki] where I teach others about software engineering. Consider taking a look. Who knows? You might just learn something new! 📖

- 🌱 Go is my favorite programming language. If you haven't taken [A Tour of Go], you should really consider it. If you prefer textbooks, I recommend [The Go Programming Language]
- 🐍 Python is my strongest programming language, but I find others have their strengths as well. I used Java for my [color theme for the IntelliJ-based IDEs][Professor Theme], and I wrote my [browser extension for Chrome and Firefox][Web Extension] in JavaScript. Each language has certain types of problems that it is particularly well-suited solve, though I try to stay flexible
- 🐚 Shell scripts are my jam! If you're trying to learn more about shell scripting, check out my [Helpful Wiki][wiki], I wrote a page about the [Z-Shell](https://helpful.wiki/zsh) that covers every topic under the sun
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [a command-line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/austintraver/wally) for [Wally][], software that helps developers flash new firmware onto their keyboard
