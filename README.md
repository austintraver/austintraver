- Student at the University of Southern California (USC) ✌🏻
- Pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science 💾

I run an educational blog called [`helpful.wiki`][wiki] where I teach others about software engineering. Consider taking a look. Who knows? You might just learn something new! 📖

- 🌱 Go is my favorite programming language. If you haven't taken [A Tour of Go], you should really consider it. If you prefer textbooks, I recommend [The Go Programming Language]
- 🐍 Python is my strongest programming language, but I find others have their strengths as well. I used Java for my [color theme for the IntelliJ-based IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16230-professor-theme), and I wrote my [browser extension for Chrome and Firefox](https://github.com/austintraver/merge) in JavaScript. Each language has certain types of problems that it is particularly well-suited solve, though I try to stay flexible
- 🐚 Shell scripts are my jam! If you're trying to learn more about shell scripting, check out my [Helpful Wiki][wiki], I wrote a page about the [Z-Shell](https://helpful.wiki/zsh) that covers every topic under the sun
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Wally][], software that helps developers flash new firmware onto their keyboard. I built [Wally's Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/austintraver/wally), which you're welcome to join in on. We can work together!
