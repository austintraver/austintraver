## About

![Pusheen](/pusheen.gif)


- Student at the University of Southern California ✌🏻
- Pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science 💾

I run an educational blog called [`helpful.wiki`][wiki] where I teach others about software engineering. Maybe take a look, who knows, you might just learn something new!

- 🌱 Currently learning the Go programming language. If you haven't taken [A Tour of Go],
      you should really consider it. If you prefer textbooks, I recommend [The Go Programming Language]
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Wally][], software that helps developers 
      flash new firmware onto their keyboard.
